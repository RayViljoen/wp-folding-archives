A simple widget providing a customisable, animated dropdown menu to display archives.

== Description ==

The Folding Archives plugin provides a sidebar widget to display archives in a small and simple jQuery dropdown menu.
The widget allows you to select how far back to display archives ( in days ), a custom title and an option for including jQuery.

The folding animation is javascript dependant, although the widget will fallback to a basic non-animated version should javascript be disabled.
